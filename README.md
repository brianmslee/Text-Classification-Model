# Text-Classification-Model

## Text classification model utilizing the Fetch20NewsGroups dataset from the Scikit-Learn library. I implemented data processing techniques such as CountVectorizer,  TfidfTransformer, and Pipeline. I also utilized Grid-Search CV for parameter tuning. There were three models: Multinomial Naive Bayes, SGD classifier, and a multi layer perceptron model.
